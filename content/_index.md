# Welcome to my website

There is a website obesity crisis. Bloated websites full of scripts, ads, and trackers are slowing your readers down every time they try to read your well-crafted content.

The site works perfectly on **any** viewing device and it's minimal (Each page is ~5kb).

My online identity is shinpu (not really interested in sharing my real name). 

I love making stupid little programs (mostly in python rn), create "gui's" with dmenu, and create a lot of bash scripts with sometimes no real use other than learning. 


I keep a list of projects I was working on which can be found in the navbar. More information can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shinpuu/).
