# Who am I?

My online ID is shinpu, I'm from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

I'm studying ICT and have a deep interest in computer science.


To pass time I read manga, program stupid little programs, create bash scripts or find new software to self host.

I plan to share some services to the public and write about some technical stuff.
